/*
What to Do:
	Save to localStorage: Implement a function to save the quiz data (questions, answers, scores) to the browser’s local storage.
	Load from localStorage: Implement a function to load stored quiz data when the user revisits the application. Use this data to restore added questions and previous quiz states.
Purpose:
    storage.js manages the quiz data’s persistence across sessions. It ensures that added questions or user progress are not lost when the page is refreshed.
