What to Do:
	Quiz Flow: Manage the overall quiz flow here. Call the necessary functions from quiz.js and dom.js to start the quiz, load questions, and proceed through the quiz as users answer each question.
	Handling Submissions: Capture the user’s answer submission, check if it’s correct, and update the score accordingly. Move to the next question or end the quiz when all questions are answered.
	Progress Tracking: Keep track of the user’s progress, such as how many questions they’ve answered and how many remain.
	Timer: Add logic for a timer to track how much time remains for each question.
	Adding New Questions: Listen for form submissions from the user when adding new questions. Validate the input and call functions from quiz.js to store the new question.
Purpose:
	app.js is the central hub that orchestrates the different components of the quiz. It ties together the logic, DOM manipulation, and storage to create a seamless user experience.
